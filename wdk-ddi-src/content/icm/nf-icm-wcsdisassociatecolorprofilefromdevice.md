# WcsDisassociateColorProfileFromDevice function


## -description


The <code>WcsDisassociateColorProfileFromDevice</code> function disassociates a specified WCS color profile from a specified device.


## -parameters




### -param scope




### -param pProfileName [in]

A pointer to the file name of the profile to disassociate.


### -param pDeviceName [in]

A pointer to the name of the device from which the profile is to be disassociated.

The device name for a monitor can be obtained from [DISPLAY_DEVICE.DeviceID](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-_display_devicea).


#### - profileManagementScope [in]

A [WCS_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/icm/ne-icm-wcs_profile_management_scope) value that specifies the scope of this profile management operation.


## -remarks


The WCS color profile should be installed on the system and must have been associated with the device using the same value for the <i>profileManagementScope</i> parameter.

If <i>profileManagementScope</i> is WCS_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE_SYSTEM_WIDE, the profile disassociation is system-wide and applies to all users. If <i>profileManagementScope</i> is WCS_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE_CURRENT_USER, the disassociation is only for the current user.

If more than one WCS color profile is associated with a device, WCS uses the last one associated as the default. That is, if your application sequentially associates three profiles with a device, WCS will use the last one associated as the default. If your application then calls the <code>WcsDisassociateColorProfileFromDevice</code> function to disassociate the third profile (which is the default in this example), WCS will use the second profile as the default.

If your application disassociates all profiles from a device, WCS uses the sRGB profile as the default.

This function is executable in Least-Privileged User Account (LUA) context if <i>profileManagementScope</i> is WCS_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE_CURRENT_USER. Otherwise, administrative privileges are required..
