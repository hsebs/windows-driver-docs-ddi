# FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev function


## -description

The **FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev** routine frees the resources that [FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev](./nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlpreparemdlwritedev.md) allocated.

## -parameters

### -param FileObject 

[in]
A pointer to the file object.

### -param FileOffset 

[in]
A pointer to a value that specifies the starting byte offset within the cache that holds the data.

### -param MdlChain 

[in]
A pointer to a linked list of memory descriptor lists (MDLs) that [FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev](./nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlpreparemdlwritedev.md) allocated.

### -param DeviceObject

[ in, optional ] A pointer to a device object on which the file is opened.

## -returns

The **FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev** routine returns **TRUE** if the operation succeeds and **FALSE** if the operation fails or if the FO_WRITE_THROUGH flag is set in the file object.

## -remarks

The **FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev** routine frees the memory descriptor lists (MDLs) that [FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev](./nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlpreparemdlwritedev.md) allocated and unlocks the cache memory that **FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev** locked.

If the FO_WRITE_THROUGH flag is set on the file object pointed to by the <i>FileObject</i> parameter, **FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev** immediately flushes the cached memory to disk. This flush operation re-enters the file system and can cause **FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev** to raise an exception if the flush operation fails. 

Each call to [FsRtlPrepareMdlWriteDev](./nf-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header-fsrtlpreparemdlwritedev.md) must be followed by a call to **FsRtlMdlWriteCompleteDev**.
