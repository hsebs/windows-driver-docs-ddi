# READ_WRITE_MITIGATED_REGISTER callback


## -description


Reads or writes to mitigated address spaces.


## -prototype


```cpp
READ_WRITE_MITIGATED_REGISTER ReadWriteMitigatedRegister;

NTSTATUS ReadWriteMitigatedRegister(
  _In_    PVOID     Context,
  _In_    USHORT    VfIndex,
  _In_    BOOLEAN   Read,
  _In_    USHORT    BarIndex,
  _In_    ULONGLONG Offset,
  _In_    ULONG     Length,
  _Inout_ PUCHAR    Data
)
{ ... }

typedef READ_WRITE_MITIGATED_REGISTER *PREAD_WRITE_MITIGATED_REGISTER;
```


## -parameters




### -param Context [in]

A pointer to a driver-defined context.




### -param VfIndex [in]

A zero-based index of the VF to which this read/write operation applies.


### -param Read [in]



                A boolean that indicates whether to perform a read or a write operation. TRUE indicates read, FALSE otherwise.


### -param BarIndex [in]

The BAR that maps the address space being mitigated.


### -param Offset [in]

The offset in number of bytes into the BAR at which this access begins.


### -param Length [in]



                The length in bytes of this read or write operation.


### -param Data [in, out]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the data to read or write.


## -returns




Return STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, return an appropriate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values">NTSTATUS</a> error code.




## -remarks



This callback function is implemented by the physical function (PF) driver. It is invoked  when the system wants to read or write from a mitigable register.

The PF driver registers its implementation by setting the <b>ReadWriteMitigatedRegister</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pcivirt/ns-pcivirt-_mitigable_device_interface">MITIGABLE_DEVICE_INTERFACE</a>, configuring a <a href="..\wdfqueryinterface\ns-wdfqueryinterface-_wdf_query_interface_config.md">WDF_QUERY_INTERFACE_CONFIG</a> structure, and calling <a href="..\wdfqueryinterface\nf-wdfqueryinterface-wdfdeviceaddqueryinterface.md">WdfDeviceAddQueryInterface</a>.
